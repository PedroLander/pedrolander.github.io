Neanderthals, thiefs and farmers. (Juris Zarins)

Adam and Eve, Garden of Eden, The Flood Myth, "you will earn the breead with your forehead's sweat".

Mesopotamia, end of last glaciation, a vast territory with good climate, soil, plants, fish and abundant animals. Plant culture in small scale occurs efortlessly, easier just concerning about fruit trees. The same happens with animals and fish culture. It would be easy to survive, even for a nowday's city person. That could be considered as the Garden of Eden. 

Given that they might have practiced, maybe as a hobby, this proto-agriculture, population became partially independent from wild food's availability and its fluctuations. That might have produced, eventually an increasse of population avobe the food a system can supply at any given moment. We can bear in mind that some fluctuations might had been consecuence of human foraging or hunting indeed. There, the hobby becomes the work, when it is needed for eating.
          
Towards the end of the glacial period, poles melt and the planet became more humid, with more copious rains and, eventually, flooding new territories. Humans from Mesopotamia would be pushed to migrate to slightly higher lands with the plant and animals they already 'domesticated' (here, there is a need to think about domesticated animal afection and the emotional distinction between pet and cattle). This would have beend the Flood Myth, retained in oral transmission of the culture until the invention of writting and The Bible. There should be figures or cave paintings representing this event though.

Up in the hills, cereals grew naturally. In case they were already sowing the wheat intentionally, they would have selected grains that remained attached to the plant (autoselection). On the contrary, if they were just harvesting the plantsthat grew naturally, over time, they would have selected the looser granins, those which would have dropped from the plane. There, the work becomes harder, some postural disorders appear, as well as some diseases related to 'civilization', as dental cavities. Mounts were suited for agriculture because during glacial periods, low 'metabolic rates' of the ecosystems would have leaded to nutrient accumulation in higher lands, producing rich and deep soils. This, couppled to hard rains, it was the perfect scenario for agriculture to develop. (Nowdays, I don't think this is logical).

Protein and nutrient production of a similar soil surface is ten times higher in a wheat field than in a pasture one. The ecological transformation is radically different though. Animals feeding on those lands lead to a change in ecosystem processes that yield other benefits to humans (depending on the type of animal), as soil nutrient enrichment, increase in species diversity, as wild herbs or honeybees and meadow-like environmts that are more resilient to mid-intensity impacts, as human activity. On the other hand, wheat farming entails soil exhaustion and hughe reduction in biodiversity, what leads to an environment ridiculously sensitive to any alteration (soil detachment, diseases that become plagues, recovery time after fires,...) and that retain less hydric and nutrient resources. This phase would have been an extractive type of agriculture, extracting the nutrients in the soil, before alternating plant species or fertilizing.
